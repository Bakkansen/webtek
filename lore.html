			<h1>The Land</h1>
			<p>Athaeros is a land of great diversity. From its scorched deserts to its northern ice wastes. Many races live side by side in perfect disharmony and eternal conflict.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h1>Humans</h1>
				<p>Humans are diverse and often versatile. Capable of possessing both great strength and great intelligence but more often Humans possess neither of the two. Their station in Athaeros is more owed to their high birth rates than anything else.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h1>Dwarves</h1>
				<p>Dwarves are greedy, intelligent, strong, but very very short. They usually prefer to live in and around mountains. Little known fact is that there are no female dwarves. They reproduce by cutting off their beards and burying it. Nine Months later a fully formed dwarf will spring up out of the ground in search of meat and mead. They often trade with humans.</p>

				<h1>Elves</h1>
				<p>Elves are fair, slender and the most intelligent of all races. Their physical strength is mediocre, but their keen talent for the magic arts more than makes up for it. Preferring forests, they keep mostly to themselves.</p>
